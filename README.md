Machine learning models (LR, LDA, KNN, CART, NB, SVM) (by J. Brownlee, https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/).

**Logistic regression (LR)** : Estimates a multiple linear regression function.<br/>
**Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** : Estimates the mean and variance from the datasetâ€™s features for each class and uses Bayes Theorem to estimate the probability of observations belonging to classes (assumes Gaussian class-conditional density models).<br/>
**k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** : Assigns class to observations based on the selected value k of its nearest neighbors in the feature space.<br/>
**Classification and regression trees (CART)** : Iterates across features and finds rules which best divide data into given classes along a tree structure.<br/>
**Naive Bayes (NB)** : Uses Bays Theorem to estimate the probability of observations belonging to classes (assumes features to be independent).<br/>
**Support-Vector Machine (SVM)** :   Observations are mapped into progressively higher dimensions until a hyperplane is found which best divides the dataset into classes (support vectors are the observations nearest to the hyperplane).<br/>
